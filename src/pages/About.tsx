			<p className='indent-10 py-3'>
				I'm a dedicated UX/UI designer based in Manila, Philippines, with a diverse background firmly rooted in
				web development. Over the years, my professional journey has encompassed roles such as web developer,
				backend, frontend, and team lead, equipping me with a wealth of experience that has honed my
				problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of various challenges. My passion lies in crafting
				user-centered designs that bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionality.
			</p>
			<p className='indent-10 py-3'>
				My extensive years of experience in web development have provided me with a unique perspective, enabling
				me to comprehend the intricacies of user interactions and translate them into intuitive and visually
				appealing designs. I'm committed to focusing on designs that not only captivate aesthetically but also
				seamlessly address user needs and pain points. Transitioning into the field of UI/UX design from my
				previous role as a senior web developer and team lead, I carry forward a strong foundation in frontend
				design and an adeptness at collaborative problem-solving.
